Hello everyone
This is our first Django project. We are making it for fun and to learn this framework. It is available on: kasztany.pythonanywhere.com
Main features of this web application:
  - user registration
  - logging in and logging out
  - user profiles with custom avatars
  - javascript games with global highscores
  - astonishing 404 site
Not every feature is ready yet.
Almost all of the commits were made together by Magda and Piotr though commit history shows something different - it lies.
